# New Minigame Ideas for Number Friends

## 1. Factor Race
**Trigger:** Perfect numbers or specific squares
**Gameplay:** All players race to list as many factors of a number as possible in 30 seconds. Type them in one by one. Each correct factor = 1 point. First incorrect answer ends your turn.
**Winner:** Most factors listed correctly
**Reward:** Winner advances by number of factors they found

## 2. Prime or Not (Speed Round)
**Trigger:** Could replace current Prime-Off or be an alternative
**Gameplay:** Numbers flash on screen rapidly (2-3 seconds each). Players tap "Prime" or "Not Prime" for each. 10 rounds.
**Winner:** Most correct answers (ties broken by speed)
**Reward:** Winner advances to next prime

## 3. Number Auction
**Trigger:** Multiples of 10
**Gameplay:** A target number is shown (e.g., 50). Players secretly bid how many spaces they'll move BACK to get a bonus. Highest bidder wins and gets to roll a d20 for bonus movement. Risk vs reward.
**Winner:** The bidder (but they moved back first)
**Reward:** d20 roll forward after moving back their bid amount

## 4. Estimation Station
**Trigger:** Perfect squares/cubes (alternative to Root Race)
**Gameplay:** Show a calculation like "√847" or "∛2197". All players guess the answer (decimals allowed). Closest wins.
**Winner:** Closest guess to actual answer
**Reward:** Winner advances spaces equal to how many digits they got correct

## 5. Sequence Snap
**Trigger:** Fibonacci squares (replacement)
**Gameplay:** A mathematical sequence is shown with one number missing (e.g., "2, 4, 8, ?, 32"). First to correctly identify the pattern and missing number wins. Sequences include: powers, triangular numbers, factorials, arithmetic/geometric progressions.
**Winner:** First correct answer
**Reward:** Advance to the next number in the Fibonacci sequence from current position

## 6. Divisibility Dash
**Trigger:** Any special square
**Gameplay:** A 3-digit number appears. Players race to identify ALL numbers 2-12 that divide it evenly. First to get all correct wins.
**Winner:** First complete correct answer
**Reward:** Move forward by count of divisors found

## 7. Math Duel
**Trigger:** When two players land on same square, or twin primes
**Gameplay:** Two players face off. A series of quick arithmetic problems. First to answer correctly gets a point. Best of 5.
**Winner:** Best of 5 rounds
**Reward:** Winner stays, loser moves back 3 spaces

## 8. Number Builder
**Trigger:** Perfect numbers
**Gameplay:** Given 4 single digits and a target number. Use +, -, ×, ÷ and parentheses to reach exactly the target (or closest). 60 seconds.
**Winner:** Whoever hits target exactly, or closest
**Reward:** Winner advances by the number of operations they used (fewer = better, max 6)

## 9. Greater/Lesser Blitz
**Trigger:** Could be a quick bonus round
**Gameplay:** Two expressions appear (e.g., "3×7" vs "25-4"). Quickly tap which is greater. 15 rounds, 3 seconds each.
**Winner:** Most correct
**Reward:** Small bonus movement (1-3 spaces)

## 10. The Remainder Game
**Trigger:** Primes or any special square
**Gameplay:** "What is the remainder when 247 is divided by 13?" All players guess. Can answer with decimals if they want to show off.
**Winner:** Correct answer (or closest)
**Reward:** Winner moves forward by the remainder itself (capped at 10)

## Recommendations for Replacements:

### For Fibonacci (Sequence Savant):
Replace with **Sequence Snap (#5)** - keeps the sequence theme but is more varied and interesting

### For Root Race (make competitive):
Transform into **Estimation Station (#4)** style - all players compete, closest decimal wins

### Alternative to Prime Blackjack:
**Math Duel (#7)** for head-to-head action, or **Prime or Not (#2)** for speed-based competition

## Implementation Priority (my suggestion):
1. Estimation Station - makes root race competitive as requested
2. Sequence Snap - fixes the "dumb" fibonacci game
3. Factor Race - adds variety
4. Number Builder - strategic and fun
5. The Remainder Game - educational and quick
